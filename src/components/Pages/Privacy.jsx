            <h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>

                <p>Our website does contain links to affiliate and other websites. Murray Electric Corp. does not claim nor accept
                    responsibility for any privacy policies, practices and/or procedures of other such websites. Therefore, we encourage
                    all users and visitors to be aware when they leave our website and to read the privacy statements of every website
                    that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy Agreement applies only and solely to the

            <h3>Notice to European Union Users</h3>

                <p>Murray Electric Corp.'s operations are located primarily in the United States. If you provide information to us, the
                    information will be transferred out of the European Union (EU) and sent to the United States. (The adequacy decision
                    on the EU-US Privacy became operational on August 1, 2016. This framework protects the fundamental rights of anyone
                    in the EU whose personal data is transferred to the United States for commercial purposes. It allows the free
                    transfer of data to companies that are certified in the US under the Privacy Shield.) By providing personal
                    information to us, you are consenting to its storage and use as described in this Policy.</p>

            <h3>Security</h3>

                <p>Murray Electric Corp. takes precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the
                    website, your information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information (e.g.
                    credit card information), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this
                    by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the
                    webpage.</p>

                <p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information
                    offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer
                    service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers and servers in which we store
                    personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. This is all done to prevent any loss, misuse,
                    unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of the user's personal information under our control.</p>

                <p>The company also uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for authentication and private communications to build users' trust
                    and confidence in the internet and website use by providing simple and secure access and communication of credit
                    card and personal information.</p>

            <h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>

                    Agreement. If you are not in agreement with our terms and conditions, then you should refrain from further use of

            <h3>GDPR Disclosure:</h3>

                <p>If you answered "yes" to the question Does your website comply with the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR")?
                    then the Privacy Policy above includes language that is meant to account for such compliance. Nevertheless, in order
                    to be fully compliant with GDPR regulations your company must fulfill other requirements such as: (i) doing an
                    assessment of data processing activities to improve security; (ii) have a data processing agreement with any third
                    party vendors; (iii) appoint a data protection officer for the company to monitor GDPR compliance; (iv) designate a
                    representative based in the EU under certain circumstances; and (v) have a protocol in place to handle a potential
                    data breach. For more details on how to make sure your company is fully compliant with GDPR, please visit the
                    official website at <a href="https://gdpr.eu">https://gdpr.eu</a>. FormSwift and its subsidiaries are in no way
                    responsible for determining whether or not your company is in fact compliant with GDPR and takes no responsibility
                    for the use you make of this Privacy Policy or for any potential liability your company may face in relation to any
                    GDPR compliance issues.</p>

            <h3>COPPA Compliance Disclosure:</h3>

                <p>This Privacy Policy presumes that your website is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly
                    collect personal identifiable information from them or allow others to do the same through your site. If this is not
                    true for your website or online service and you do collect such information (or allow others to do so), please be
                    aware that you must be compliant with all COPPA regulations and guidelines in order to avoid violations which could
                    lead to law enforcement actions, including civil penalties.</p>

                <p>In order to be fully compliant with COPPA your website or online service must fulfill other requirements such as: (i)
                    posting a privacy policy which describes not only your practices, but also the practices of any others collecting
                    personal information on your site or service — for example, plug-ins or ad networks; (ii) include a prominent link
                    to your privacy policy anywhere you collect personal information from children; (iii) include a description of
                    parental rights (e.g. that you won't require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary, that
                    they can review their child's personal information, direct you to delete it, and refuse to allow any further
                    collection or use of the child's information, and the procedures to exercise their rights); (iv) give parents
                    "direct notice" of your information practices before collecting information from their children; and (v) obtain the
                    parents' "verifiable consent" before collecting, using or disclosing personal information from a child. For more
                    information on the definition of these terms and how to make sure your website or online service is fully compliant
                    with COPPA please visit <a

                    FormSwift and its subsidiaries are in no way responsible for determining whether or not your company is in fact
                    compliant with COPPA and takes no responsibility for the use you make of this Privacy Policy or for any potential
                    liability your company may face in relation to any COPPA compliance issues.</p>
