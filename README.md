# What I've Accomplished

- I started by setting up a new react project. I then installed the necessary react-router-dom to allow for proper routing.

- I also researched a good setup for css and running the React enviornment. I saw that there was a good amount of hype around Vite and TailwindCSS. I watched tutorials to help me install and setup both in a new React App. This was my starting point. Tailwind especially is new for me. I did my best to implement it. I'm sure it's not perfect, but I gave it my best attempt to learn and implement it.
